## More information

You're using [q2d2](https://github.com/gregcaporaso/q2d2), a prototype system that [we're](https://github.com/gregcaporaso/q2d2/graphs/contributors) developing to explore some ideas related to microbiome bioinformatics reproducibility and transparency as we start developing [QIIME](http://www.qiime.org) 2 (which, as of this writing, doesn't exist).

If you have questions or comments, you should post them on the [q2d2 issue tracker](https://github.com/gregcaporaso/q2d2/issues).

If you're interested in news on QIIME 2 as it develops, you should follow [@gregcaporaso](https://twitter.com/gregcaporaso) on Twitter (we'll eventually have a dedicated QIIME Twitter account).

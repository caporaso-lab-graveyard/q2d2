# Learning QIIME

To get started with learning QIIME, you should begin with the [QIIME tutorials](http://qiime.org/tutorials/index.html).

Once you've worked through the *Getting Started* tutorials, you can begin to branch out to some of the additional functionality. You can browse the available QIIME scripts in the [QIIME script index](http://scripts.qiime.org), which provides links to their help text. Most of the QIIME scripts contain usage examples that are based on real data. To try these usage examples, you can download the files from the corresponding directory in [``qiime_test_data``](https://github.com/biocore/qiime/tree/master/qiime_test_data). These files can also serve as examples of what your input files should look like. The same help text that is linked from the [QIIME script index](http://scripts.qiime.org) is also available by calling a QIIME script with the ``-h`` option (for example ``print_qiime_config.py -h``).

QIIME workshops offer the opportunity to learn from the QIIME developers in person, and typically cover QIIME and microbial community analysis, and provide an opportunity to gain hands-on experience with QIIME. Attending a QIIME workshop or hosting an official QIIME workshop at your location are excellent opportunities to get started with QIIME. See the [QIIME workshop page](http://workshops.qiime.org) for details.

# Getting help with QIIME

The [QIIME Forum](http://forum.qiime.org) is your primary resource for getting help with QIIME. Going to the QIIME Forum for help is much more efficient than contacting developers directly, as we have a large team of QIIME developers who regularly monitor the forum. **We try to respond to questions posted on the QIIME Forum within one work day. On the other hand, if you email a QIIME developer directly, it may take days or weeks to get a response.** Additionally, providing technical support for QIIME in a public forum allows us to reduce our support burden because other users can learn from our answers to your questions. This allows the developers to focus more time on improving QIIME and on our own research projects.

Before posting a question on the QIIME Forum, you should begin by searching to see if your question has already been answered. A good way to do this is to post an error message that you received in the search box.

If you can't find an answer to your question, you should post a new question.
